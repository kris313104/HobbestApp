# Hobbest Dating App
A mobile app that allows users to find other people with similar interests through a liking system. The app focuses on the interests and hobbies of other users. Unlike other dating apps, Hobbest does not allow users to show their faces to others. This helps to prevent users from being judged based on their appearance and neglecting their interests and personality traits. When two users express their mutual interest, the ability to communicate with each other through the app's built-in chat system is unlocked.
